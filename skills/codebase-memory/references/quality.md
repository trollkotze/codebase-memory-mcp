# Code Quality Analysis

Use graph degree filtering to find dead code, high-complexity functions, and refactor candidates — all in single tool calls.

## Dead Code Detection

Find functions with zero inbound CALLS edges, excluding entry points:

```
search_graph(
  label="Function",
  relationship="CALLS",
  direction="inbound",
  max_degree=0,
  exclude_entry_points=true
)
```

`exclude_entry_points=true` removes route handlers, `main()`, and framework-registered functions that have zero callers by design.

### Verify Dead Code Candidates

Before deleting, verify each candidate truly has no callers:

```
trace_call_path(function_name="SuspectFunction", direction="inbound", depth=1)
```

Also check for read references (callbacks, stored in variables):

```
query_graph(query="MATCH (a)-[r:USAGE]->(b) WHERE b.name = 'SuspectFunction' RETURN a.name, a.file_path LIMIT 10")
```

## High Fan-Out Functions (calling 10+ others)

Refactor candidates — often doing too much:

```
search_graph(
  label="Function",
  relationship="CALLS",
  direction="outbound",
  min_degree=10
)
```

## High Fan-In Functions (called by 10+ others)

Critical functions — changes have wide impact:

```
search_graph(
  label="Function",
  relationship="CALLS",
  direction="inbound",
  min_degree=10
)
```

## Files That Change Together (Hidden Coupling)

```
query_graph(query="MATCH (a)-[r:FILE_CHANGES_WITH]->(b) WHERE r.coupling_score >= 0.5 RETURN a.name, b.name, r.coupling_score, r.co_change_count ORDER BY r.coupling_score DESC LIMIT 20")
```

High coupling between unrelated files suggests hidden dependencies.

## Unused Imports

```
search_graph(
  relationship="IMPORTS",
  direction="outbound",
  max_degree=0,
  label="Module"
)
```

## Tips

- `search_graph` with degree filters has no row cap (unlike `query_graph` which caps at 200).
- Use `file_pattern` to scope analysis: `file_pattern="**/services/**"`.
- Dead code detection works best after a full index.
- Paginate results with `limit` and `offset` — check `has_more`.
